# MiniHeap
Implementation using MiniHeap. This project implements a MinHeap (Minimum Heap) data structure in Java. A MinHeap is a specialized binary tree-based heap data structure where the key of each node is smaller than the keys of its children. It is commonly used for efficiently implementing priority queues, where the minimum element is always accessed in constant time.
